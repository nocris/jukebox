HELLO MATE! 
This is my Jukebox! 
You can select your favorite album and listen to it in complete serenity.

To add new music, you need to access the admin page:
From the homepage, type "casu marzu," and voilÃ , you're on the admin page where you can add new artists, new albums, and new songs.

You can find the mockup and the original UML Schema in the 'assets/Docs' folder of the project.

Planned features in the next version:

- CSS styling for the homepage
- Search bar to find our favorite albums
- Database update (New UML Schema)
- End-to-end testing of the admin page"
- Add the input choice for artists and albums if new
- Bug notice in admin page: 
    If I click in new song button => new album => new artist --- OK
    If I click in new artist => new album => new song button --- Doesn't work
- Change the path of album doing something like this: 
    public/upload/artist/albums/songs (not really needed)
